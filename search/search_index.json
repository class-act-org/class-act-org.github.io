Welcome to a guide that introduces a novel approach to technical interviews in the software industry: flipping the interview by focusing on a live demo of your work. This technique is beneficial for both stakeholders and candidates, creating a more engaging, practical way to assess and showcase technical skills. As someone on the autism spectrum , I\u2019ve personally found that traditional technical interviews often don\u2019t reflect the realities of how I work day-to-day. They tend to focus on isolated problem-solving under pressure, which can be challenging for anyone, but especially so when neurodivergence affects how you process information in high-pressure situations. That\u2019s why this demo-based approach offers a more inclusive and comprehensive way to evaluate skills, allowing for a more natural flow of conversation and interaction around a project the candidate has already built. Whether you're the stakeholder looking for a deeper understanding of a candidate's capabilities or the interviewee wanting to take control of the interview process, this guide will walk you through how to successfully implement this approach. For Stakeholders As an stakeholder, this method helps you gain a clearer, more hands-on understanding of a candidate's problem-solving abilities. Rather than sticking to coding challenges and questions, you\u2019ll be able to see how the candidate works in real-world scenarios, engage with their project, and ask detailed questions. Explore how to: Encourage candidates to demo their work. Ask the right questions during a demo. Evaluate a candidate's ability to adapt and explain their decisions. Start Here: Stakeholder\u2019s Guide For Candidates As an interviewee, flipping the interview gives you control over the process. By offering to demo something you've built, you can showcase your real-world experience and technical depth, all while engaging the stakeholders in a dialogue about your skills.

This guide presents a novel approach to career job interviews 1 in the tech industry, especially tailored for situations like the Technical Interview. As someone on the autism spectrum, I\u2019ve personally struggled with the typical interview format. The traditional technical interview\u2014with its focus on coding challenges and rapid problem-solving\u2014doesn\u2019t closely reflect the day-to-day realities of software development. That\u2019s why I propose an alternative: Flip the interview on its head by doing a demo instead. This guide outlines how you can vastly improve the effectiveness of the limited time in an interview by showcasing your work through a live demonstration. By allowing the stakeholders to engage with your project in real-time, you create an opportunity for genuine dialogue and deeper insight into your capabilities. 1. Introduction Traditional technical interviews emphasize coding challenges, hypothetical problem-solving, and a rapid-fire sequence of questions. While these methods can be effective, they often fail to allow candidates to fully demonstrate their abilities. By flipping the interview format, you can create a more dynamic scenario where candidates demo something they\u2019ve built, allowing you to see their real-world skills in action. 2. Why Flip the Interview? A demo gives you the chance to observe a candidate\u2019s skills in a more practical, engaging way. Rather than relying solely on their ability to explain concepts, you\u2019ll see how they apply those concepts in real scenarios. This approach encourages two-way engagement, allowing you to ask real-time questions and dig deeper into their thought processes, technical decisions, and problem-solving abilities. 3. How to Structure the Demo When setting up the interview, encourage candidates to choose a project that aligns with your company\u2019s interests or demonstrates the skills relevant to the role. Make it clear that you expect a thorough walkthrough of their technical decisions, design choices, and implementation details. Let them know it\u2019s an open forum, where you\u2019ll ask questions throughout, ensuring the conversation remains interactive rather than a one-sided presentation. 4. What Does This Achieve? This method allows you to focus on both depth and breadth, gaining a more thorough understanding of the candidate\u2019s expertise. By seeing how they handle a real project, you\u2019ll be able to assess their problem-solving skills within a practical context, moving away from abstract or hypothetical scenarios. The format also encourages more spontaneous questions, stress-testing the candidate\u2019s ability to think on their feet and adapt to new challenges. 5. Potential Pitfalls While this method has its advantages, it does require that the candidate be thoroughly prepared to discuss their project in detail. Be mindful that some candidates may not have a project that aligns perfectly with your domain, which could create a disconnect. Additionally, while this approach may not work for every interview, it can be particularly effective for roles that require deeper technical discussions and real-world problem-solving. 6. Closing the Deal A successful demo interview doesn\u2019t just show your technical skills\u2014it demonstrates your ability to communicate, adapt, and think critically in real-time. For stakeholders, this process offers a unique perspective on how candidates approach problem-solving in practical, real-world scenarios. For Candidates, it\u2019s an opportunity to leave a lasting impression by taking control of the narrative. Embrace the conversation, be open to feedback, and show them how you\u2019ll make an impact beyond just answering questions. To clarify, A career job interview , in this context, is any interview for a higher-level (senior and above) position that would benefit from a demonstration of knowledge approach. \u21a9","title":"As a Candidate"},{"location":"candidate/#flip-the-interview-on-its-head-do-a-demo-instead","text":"This guide presents a novel approach to career job interviews 1 in the tech industry, especially tailored for situations like the Technical Interview.

While this approach can test certain skills, it doesn\u2019t always reveal how candidates will perform in real-world, day-to-day situations\u2014particularly when it comes to solving actual business problems. By flipping the interview , you invite the candidate to demonstrate their work in a hands-on way by walking you through a project they\u2019ve built. This allows you to assess not only their technical proficiency but also their problem-solving process, decision-making skills, and ability to communicate complex ideas. Why Flip the Interview? Shifting the focus from isolated questions to a live demo provides several advantages: Real-World Insights : Instead of theoretical problem-solving, you see firsthand how a candidate tackles real-world challenges. This offers a clearer picture of how their skills will apply to the types of projects they\u2019d work on with your team. Evaluate Thought Process : A demo allows you to dig into the candidate\u2019s decision-making process, asking questions about why certain technical decisions were made, how challenges were addressed, and what trade-offs were considered. Interactive Dialogue : Unlike a traditional interview, where candidates respond to predefined questions, a demo encourages a more organic, two-way conversation. You can dive deeper into areas of interest, making the interview more engaging and insightful. How Does It Work? As an stakeholder, you would ask the candidate to walk through a project they\u2019ve built, ideally one that showcases relevant skills for the role. During the demo, you can: Ask about the project's goals and the problems it solves. Dive into specific technical details, exploring their approach to design, architecture, or particular challenges. Assess how well the candidate can communicate their ideas, explaining complex decisions in a way that makes sense to both technical and non-technical team members. By encouraging the candidate to walk through their work, you shift the focus from answering theoretical questions to showcasing how they apply their skills in real-world scenarios. This shift in approach often leads to a more engaging and revealing interview. Setting the Stage To introduce this concept to the candidate, you can frame it as an opportunity for them to showcase their work in a practical setting. Here\u2019s how you might present the idea during the interview: \"Rather than focusing on typical coding challenges, I\u2019d like to invite you to walk me through a project you\u2019ve worked on. This will give us a chance to see how you solve real-world problems and the technical decisions you made along the way.\" This method helps create a more collaborative and dynamic interview environment, giving both you and the candidate a clearer picture of their fit for the role.","title":"Introduction: Flipping the Interview as an Stakeholder"},{"location":"candidate/introduction/#introduction-flipping-the-interview-as-an-stakeholder","text":"In traditional technical interviews, the emphasis is often placed on a candidate\u2019s ability to solve coding challenges or answer hypothetical questions quickly.

Here are some common challenges and strategies to avoid them: 1. Misalignment with the Role One of the key challenges with a demo-based interview is ensuring that the project the candidate presents is relevant to the role you\u2019re hiring for. If the project doesn\u2019t align with your company\u2019s domain or the specific skills required, it can be difficult to assess the candidate\u2019s fit. How to Avoid : During the interview setup, provide the candidate with guidance on selecting a relevant project. You might suggest they focus on a project that aligns with the technologies or challenges your team faces. If the candidate\u2019s demo still doesn\u2019t seem aligned, ask them how they would apply the same problem-solving approach or technical decisions to your company\u2019s specific needs. 2. Surface-Level Presentation Some candidates may prepare a polished demo but fail to dive deeply into the technical details. This can lead to a surface-level understanding of their skills and problem-solving abilities. How to Avoid : Encourage the candidate to dive deep into their technical decisions and challenges during the demo. Ask probing questions like: \"Can you explain the trade-offs you considered when choosing this architecture?\" \"What specific challenges did you face with performance, and how did you resolve them?\" This will ensure you get a more complete picture of their technical depth. 3. Overemphasis on Presentation Skills While a demo can provide insight into a candidate\u2019s communication and technical skills, there\u2019s a risk that stakeholders may overemphasize presentation skills, which may not be directly relevant to the role. How to Avoid : Keep the focus on the content of the demo rather than how polished the presentation is. Make sure to assess the candidate\u2019s technical decisions, problem-solving approach, and adaptability rather than how smooth or well-rehearsed the demo is. You can even ask questions that shift the candidate\u2019s focus away from the script, such as: \"What were the most challenging parts of this project, and how did you handle them?\" 4. Failing to Assess Adaptability While a demo offers great insight into a candidate\u2019s prepared project, it doesn\u2019t always test how well they can adapt to new challenges or feedback on the spot. How to Avoid : During the demo, ask the candidate about alternative approaches or how they would handle new requirements. For example: \"If this project had required you to scale to ten times the traffic, what changes would you have made?\" \"How would you modify your approach if you had to switch to a different technology stack?\" These questions will help you assess their ability to think on their feet and adapt to changing circumstances. 5. Overcomplicating the Demo Sometimes, candidates may choose projects that are overly complex or difficult to explain in a limited time frame. This can make it hard for you to fully grasp their contributions or technical decisions. How to Avoid : Encourage the candidate to focus on a project they can explain thoroughly within the time allotted. If the project is large, suggest they focus on a few key components rather than trying to cover everything. You can also guide the discussion by focusing on specific aspects of the project that are most relevant to the role: \"Let\u2019s focus on how you handled the performance bottlenecks in this system.\" 6. Lack of Preparation by the Candidate A demo-based interview requires thorough preparation from the candidate. If the candidate is underprepared, it can lead to an ineffective or disorganized demo. How to Avoid : Set clear expectations for the candidate in advance. Let them know that you\u2019ll be asking in-depth technical questions and expect a detailed walk-through of their project. If they seem unprepared during the interview, you can pivot by asking broader questions to gauge their overall thought process and problem-solving approach. Conclusion While the demo format offers numerous benefits, being aware of these potential pitfalls ensures that you get the most value from the interview. By providing clear guidance to the candidate, asking the right questions, and maintaining a focus on technical depth and relevance, you can avoid these challenges and ensure a successful, insightful interview.","title":"Potential Pitfalls"},{"location":"candidate/pitfalls/#potential-pitfalls","text":"While the demo-based interview offers significant advantages, it\u2019s important to be aware of potential pitfalls that can undermine its effectiveness.

Better Hiring Decisions"},{"location":"candidate/why/","text":"Why Flip the Interview? Traditional technical interviews focus heavily on coding challenges, whiteboard problem-solving, or algorithmic questions. While these methods have their place, they don\u2019t always reflect how a candidate operates in the real world, where the problems are more nuanced, the constraints are different, and the work is collaborative and ongoing. By flipping the interview \u2014asking candidates to demo a project they\u2019ve built instead\u2014you get a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of their abilities. Here\u2019s why this approach can offer significant advantages. 1. Real-World Problem Solving In a live demo, candidates aren\u2019t solving hypothetical problems or tackling isolated coding exercises. Instead, they\u2019re walking you through how they\u2019ve applied their skills to solve actual problems. This offers several benefits: - Context Matters : You get to see how they approached a problem from start to finish, including the requirements, constraints, and real-world challenges that influenced their decisions. - Practical Skills : The demo highlights skills that may not show up in algorithmic interviews, such as system architecture, technical trade-offs, scalability concerns, and how they handle unexpected challenges. In short, you see how the candidate operates in scenarios much more similar to the real job, which gives you a better sense of their capabilities. 2. Evaluate the Candidate\u2019s Thought Process A traditional interview often focuses on what the candidate knows in isolation\u2014whether they can answer a specific question or solve a coding problem. But a demo offers insight into why they made the choices they did. You get to explore: - Decision-Making : Why did they choose this particular technology stack? What alternatives did they consider? How did they weigh performance versus maintainability? - Problem-Solving : What specific challenges did they face during the project, and how did they overcome them? Were there any roadblocks, and how did they adapt? - Trade-Offs : Every project has constraints\u2014time, resources, or technical limitations. A demo lets you evaluate how the candidate navigated those trade-offs and managed complexity. This deeper look into their thought process helps you assess how they\u2019ll handle the day-to-day technical challenges of the role. 3. Encourage a Two-Way Dialogue In traditional interviews, candidates often feel like they\u2019re on the defensive\u2014answering a stream of questions without much room for real conversation. In contrast, a demo invites a collaborative, two-way dialogue : - Real-Time Questions : You can ask about specific parts of the project as they present it. For example, you might dive into how they handled scaling issues or how they optimized for performance. - Engagement : A demo allows the interview to flow more naturally, resembling a discussion between colleagues. This can lead to a more open, relaxed atmosphere, where you\u2019re learning about the candidate while also seeing how they interact and communicate. This dynamic not only helps the candidate feel more comfortable, but it also gives you a better sense of how they\u2019ll work as part of a team\u2014responding to feedback, collaborating, and explaining their thinking to both technical and non-technical team members. 4. Test Adaptability and Depth One of the biggest benefits of a demo is that it\u2019s adaptable based on what you find interesting. You can choose to dive deeper into the areas of the project that are most relevant to the role: - Probe for Depth : Ask the candidate to explain a specific part of their project, such as how they handled a performance bottleneck or what security measures they implemented. This allows you to test not just their broad knowledge, but their ability to go deep into the technical details. - On-the-Fly Problem Solving : As you ask questions during the demo, you\u2019ll be able to evaluate how the candidate responds in real time. Can they explain their work clearly? Are they able to defend their decisions or consider alternative approaches? Do they show flexibility in their thinking when faced with new challenges? This approach helps you assess how adaptable and resourceful the candidate is when working under pressure, a key indicator of how they\u2019ll perform on the job. 5. More Insightful Hiring Decisions At the end of a demo-based interview, you\u2019ll likely have a much richer and more nuanced understanding of the candidate\u2019s skills, strengths, and potential fit within your team: - Holistic Evaluation : You\u2019re not just looking at whether the candidate can solve algorithmic problems in a vacuum\u2014you\u2019re assessing how they solve real-world problems, make decisions, communicate, and adapt. - Relevant Skills : You can easily identify whether the candidate has the practical skills and experience needed to succeed in the specific role you\u2019re hiring for, instead of relying on generalized problem-solving abilities. - Cultural Fit : A demo gives you a sense of how the candidate explains their work, interacts with feedback, and presents themselves\u2014all key components of fitting into a team culture. Ultimately, flipping the interview gives you a better sense of the candidate\u2019s real-world abilities and how they might contribute to your team in practice, rather than in theory.","title":"Why Flip the Interview?"},{"location":"candidate/why/#why-flip-the-interview","text":"Traditional technical interviews focus heavily on coding challenges, whiteboard problem-solving, or algorithmic questions.

This allows you to test not just their broad knowledge, but their ability to go deep into the technical details. - On-the-Fly Problem Solving : As you ask questions during the demo, you\u2019ll be able to evaluate how the candidate responds in real time. Can they explain their work clearly? Are they able to defend their decisions or consider alternative approaches? Do they show flexibility in their thinking when faced with new challenges? This approach helps you assess how adaptable and resourceful the candidate is when working under pressure, a key indicator of how they\u2019ll perform on the job.","title":"4.

Ultimately, flipping the interview gives you a better sense of the candidate\u2019s real-world abilities and how they might contribute to your team in practice, rather than in theory.","title":"5. More Insightful Hiring Decisions"},{"location":"stakeholder/","text":"Flip the Interview on Its Head, Do a Demo Instead! This guide presents a novel approach to career job interviews in the tech industry, particularly helpful for candidates who want to showcase their strengths in a more dynamic way. Traditional technical interviews often focus on coding challenges and rapid problem-solving, which don\u2019t always mirror the realities of software development. That\u2019s why you can take control of the process by flipping the interview on its head: offer to do a demo instead. This guide will help you prepare to present this idea to stakeholders and walk you through how to structure and deliver a live demonstration of your work, helping you stand out and create a more interactive, engaging interview experience. 1. Presenting the Idea In most interviews, you're expected to answer technical questions or solve problems on the spot. However, this doesn\u2019t always allow you to showcase your real-world experience. When you propose a demo, you\u2019re suggesting a shift in focus: instead of just answering questions, you invite the stakeholders to explore something you\u2019ve built. Let them know they can ask questions at any point, making it a two-way conversation that demonstrates your expertise. 2. Why Do a Demo? A demo allows you to show what you\u2019ve accomplished instead of just explaining concepts. You\u2019re in control of the narrative, choosing a project that highlights your strengths and aligns with the company\u2019s interests. This format also encourages a more relaxed dialogue, where you can engage with real-time questions, giving the stakeholders a clearer understanding of your thought process and decision-making. 3. How to Prepare and Structure Your Demo Choose a project that demonstrates your skills and is relevant to the role you\u2019re applying for. Prepare to walk through your decisions step by step\u2014be ready to explain design choices, technical trade-offs, and specific lines of code if necessary. Encourage questions from the stakeholders, making the experience interactive. This isn\u2019t just a presentation; it\u2019s a conversation where you can dive deep and address their curiosity. 4. What This Approach Achieves By leading with a demo, you highlight both the depth and breadth of your skills. You\u2019re showing your ability to solve real-world problems, which stakeholders can connect to the challenges they face. This method also allows for spontaneous questions, testing your ability to think on your feet and adapt to new inquiries, which can leave a lasting impression. 5. How to Avoid Pitfalls The key to success is thorough preparation. Make sure you know your project inside out and can answer questions at any level of depth. If your project isn\u2019t directly related to the company\u2019s domain, find ways to connect it to the job you're interviewing for. While this approach may not work for every interview, in the right context, it can set you apart from other candidates. 6. How to Close the Interview Strong A successful demo not only showcases your technical abilities but also highlights your communication skills, adaptability, and ability to engage with complex problems. By using this approach, you leave stakeholders with a clear sense of how you operate in real-world scenarios. Encourage open feedback and be ready to explain how your skills will translate into real impact for their team. To clarify, A career job interview , in this context, is any interview for a higher-level (senior and above) position that would benefit from a demonstration of knowledge approach. \u21a9","title":"As a Stakeholder"},{"location":"stakeholder/#flip-the-interview-on-its-head-do-a-demo-instead","text":"This guide presents a novel approach to career job interviews in the tech industry, particularly helpful for candidates who want to showcase their strengths in a more dynamic way.
