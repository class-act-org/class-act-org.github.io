# How to Structure the Demo

A demo interview shifts the focus from isolated coding challenges to a more hands-on demonstration of the candidate’s real-world problem-solving abilities. As an interviewer, guiding the structure of the demo is key to ensuring it provides the insights you need while giving the candidate a chance to showcase their skills effectively.

Here’s how you can help structure the demo for the best results:

### 1. Set the Context

Start by asking the candidate to set the stage for the demo. This will help you understand the scope and goals of the project.

- **Ask About the Project’s Purpose**: 
   - _"What was the goal of this project? What problem were you trying to solve, and who was the end user?"_
   - This gives you insight into the high-level objectives of the project and the candidate’s understanding of the problem space.

- **Understand the Scope and Requirements**: 
   - _"Were there any specific constraints or requirements that shaped how you approached this project?"_
   - This helps you gauge how the candidate navigates limitations like deadlines, resource constraints, or client needs.

### 2. Walk Through Key Features

Encourage the candidate to highlight the most important parts of the project. This is where they can showcase their technical abilities, design decisions, and problem-solving approach.

- **Focus on Core Components**:
   - _"Can you walk me through the key features of the project? What are the main technical challenges you addressed?"_
   - This question allows them to focus on areas where they had the most impact, and you get to see how they approached complex technical problems.

- **Highlight Design and Architectural Choices**:
   - _"What architecture did you choose for this project, and why? Were there any specific design patterns you relied on?"_
   - Understanding the architecture gives you insight into their technical decision-making and design skills.

### 3. Dive into the Details

Once the candidate has presented the core of their project, you can begin to dive deeper into specific areas that are relevant to the role. This is where you can probe for deeper technical knowledge.

- **Ask About Technical Challenges**:
   - _"What specific technical challenges did you face during this project? How did you overcome them?"_
   - This gives the candidate a chance to show their problem-solving skills, particularly how they handle difficult or unexpected situations.

- **Explore Performance and Optimization**:
   - _"Were there any performance bottlenecks or optimization challenges? How did you handle them?"_
   - This question allows you to evaluate their approach to efficiency, scalability, and optimization—key areas for technical roles.

- **Investigate Trade-Offs**:
   - _"Were there any trade-offs you had to make? How did you decide which approach was best given the constraints?"_
   - Every project involves trade-offs. This helps you understand how they prioritize and balance competing factors like performance, cost, and maintainability.

### 4. Encourage Real-Time Problem Solving

Asking questions throughout the demo allows you to see how the candidate thinks on their feet and adapts to new challenges or scrutiny.

- **Probe Unexpected Areas**:
   - _"If you had more time or resources, what would you have done differently?"_
   - This question allows the candidate to reflect on their work, showing how they might improve or refine the project.

- **Test Adaptability**:
   - _"If you had to pivot this project to a different technology or requirement, how would you approach it?"_
   - This helps you assess how flexible the candidate is and whether they can adapt to changing circumstances, a critical skill in fast-moving environments.

### 5. Maintain a Collaborative Dialogue

Throughout the demo, maintain a balance between asking questions and letting the candidate lead the discussion. The goal is to create a dynamic and engaging conversation.

- **Encourage Open Communication**:
   - _"Feel free to explain your thought process as we go. I’d like to understand not just what you built, but why you made those decisions."_
   - This lets the candidate know you’re interested in their reasoning and encourages them to provide deeper insights.

- **Be Ready to Pivot**:
   - If you discover an area of the project that is particularly relevant or impressive, don’t be afraid to focus more attention on it.
   - _"I’m really interested in how you solved that scaling issue—can we dive deeper into your approach there?"_

### 6. Wrap Up and Reflect

At the end of the demo, ask the candidate to summarize their key takeaways and reflect on the project. This is a good moment to connect their work to the specific challenges of the role you’re hiring for.

- **Recap the Project**:
   - _"To summarize, what do you think were the most important aspects of this project in terms of problem-solving and technical challenges?"_
   - This helps both you and the candidate refocus on the main achievements and skills demonstrated during the demo.

- **Connect It to the Role**:
   - _"How do you think the skills you demonstrated here would apply to the challenges we’re facing on our team?"_
   - This ties the conversation back to your specific needs and helps you evaluate how the candidate’s skills fit into your organization.

### Conclusion

By structuring the demo in this way, you ensure that it remains focused, interactive, and relevant to the role. You’ll gain deeper insights into the candidate’s problem-solving abilities, technical depth, and communication skills—all while evaluating their real-world experience in action.

The flexibility of this approach allows you to dig deeper into areas of interest and create a more engaging, dynamic interview process that benefits both you and the candidate.
