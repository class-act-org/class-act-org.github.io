# Why Flip the Interview?

Traditional technical interviews focus heavily on coding challenges, whiteboard problem-solving, or algorithmic questions. While these methods have their place, they don’t always reflect how a candidate operates in the real world, where the problems are more nuanced, the constraints are different, and the work is collaborative and ongoing.

By **flipping the interview**—asking candidates to demo a project they’ve built instead—you get a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of their abilities. Here’s why this approach can offer significant advantages.

### 1. Real-World Problem Solving

In a live demo, candidates aren’t solving hypothetical problems or tackling isolated coding exercises. Instead, they’re walking you through how they’ve applied their skills to solve actual problems. This offers several benefits:
- **Context Matters**: You get to see how they approached a problem from start to finish, including the requirements, constraints, and real-world challenges that influenced their decisions.
- **Practical Skills**: The demo highlights skills that may not show up in algorithmic interviews, such as system architecture, technical trade-offs, scalability concerns, and how they handle unexpected challenges.

In short, you see how the candidate operates in scenarios much more similar to the real job, which gives you a better sense of their capabilities.

### 2. Evaluate the Candidate’s Thought Process

A traditional interview often focuses on what the candidate knows in isolation—whether they can answer a specific question or solve a coding problem. But a demo offers insight into **why** they made the choices they did. You get to explore:
- **Decision-Making**: Why did they choose this particular technology stack? What alternatives did they consider? How did they weigh performance versus maintainability?
- **Problem-Solving**: What specific challenges did they face during the project, and how did they overcome them? Were there any roadblocks, and how did they adapt?
- **Trade-Offs**: Every project has constraints—time, resources, or technical limitations. A demo lets you evaluate how the candidate navigated those trade-offs and managed complexity.

This deeper look into their thought process helps you assess how they’ll handle the day-to-day technical challenges of the role.

### 3. Encourage a Two-Way Dialogue

In traditional interviews, candidates often feel like they’re on the defensive—answering a stream of questions without much room for real conversation. In contrast, a demo invites a **collaborative, two-way dialogue**:
- **Real-Time Questions**: You can ask about specific parts of the project as they present it. For example, you might dive into how they handled scaling issues or how they optimized for performance.
- **Engagement**: A demo allows the interview to flow more naturally, resembling a discussion between colleagues. This can lead to a more open, relaxed atmosphere, where you’re learning about the candidate while also seeing how they interact and communicate.

This dynamic not only helps the candidate feel more comfortable, but it also gives you a better sense of how they’ll work as part of a team—responding to feedback, collaborating, and explaining their thinking to both technical and non-technical team members.

### 4. Test Adaptability and Depth

One of the biggest benefits of a demo is that it’s adaptable based on what you find interesting. You can choose to dive deeper into the areas of the project that are most relevant to the role:
- **Probe for Depth**: Ask the candidate to explain a specific part of their project, such as how they handled a performance bottleneck or what security measures they implemented. This allows you to test not just their broad knowledge, but their ability to go deep into the technical details.
- **On-the-Fly Problem Solving**: As you ask questions during the demo, you’ll be able to evaluate how the candidate responds in real time. Can they explain their work clearly? Are they able to defend their decisions or consider alternative approaches? Do they show flexibility in their thinking when faced with new challenges?

This approach helps you assess how adaptable and resourceful the candidate is when working under pressure, a key indicator of how they’ll perform on the job.

### 5. More Insightful Hiring Decisions

At the end of a demo-based interview, you’ll likely have a much richer and more nuanced understanding of the candidate’s skills, strengths, and potential fit within your team:
- **Holistic Evaluation**: You’re not just looking at whether the candidate can solve algorithmic problems in a vacuum—you’re assessing how they solve real-world problems, make decisions, communicate, and adapt.
- **Relevant Skills**: You can easily identify whether the candidate has the practical skills and experience needed to succeed in the specific role you’re hiring for, instead of relying on generalized problem-solving abilities.
- **Cultural Fit**: A demo gives you a sense of how the candidate explains their work, interacts with feedback, and presents themselves—all key components of fitting into a team culture.

Ultimately, flipping the interview gives you a better sense of the candidate’s **real-world abilities** and how they might contribute to your team in practice, rather than in theory.
