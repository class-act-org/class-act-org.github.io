# Flip the Interview on Its Head, Do a Demo Instead!

This guide presents a novel approach to career job interviews[^1] in the tech industry, especially tailored for situations like the Technical Interview. As someone on the autism spectrum, I’ve personally struggled with the typical interview format. The traditional technical interview—with its focus on coding challenges and rapid problem-solving—doesn’t closely reflect the day-to-day realities of software development.

That’s why I propose an alternative: Flip the interview on its head by doing a demo instead.

This guide outlines how you can vastly improve the effectiveness of the limited time in an interview by showcasing your work through a live demonstration. By allowing the interviewers to engage with your project in real-time, you create an opportunity for genuine dialogue and deeper insight into your capabilities.

# 1. [Introduction](/intro)

Traditional technical interviews emphasize coding challenges, hypothetical problem-solving, and a rapid-fire sequence of questions. While these methods can be effective, they often fail to allow candidates to fully demonstrate their abilities. By flipping the interview format, you can create a more dynamic scenario where candidates demo something they’ve built, allowing you to see their real-world skills in action.

# 2. [Why Flip the Interview?](/why)

A demo gives you the chance to observe a candidate’s skills in a more practical, engaging way. Rather than relying solely on their ability to explain concepts, you’ll see how they apply those concepts in real scenarios. This approach encourages two-way engagement, allowing you to ask real-time questions and dig deeper into their thought processes, technical decisions, and problem-solving abilities.

# 3. [How to Structure the Demo](/structure)

When setting up the interview, encourage candidates to choose a project that aligns with your company’s interests or demonstrates the skills relevant to the role. Make it clear that you expect a thorough walkthrough of their technical decisions, design choices, and implementation details. Let them know it’s an open forum, where you’ll ask questions throughout, ensuring the conversation remains interactive rather than a one-sided presentation.

# 4. [What Does This Achieve?](/what)

This method allows you to focus on both depth and breadth, gaining a more thorough understanding of the candidate’s expertise. By seeing how they handle a real project, you’ll be able to assess their problem-solving skills within a practical context, moving away from abstract or hypothetical scenarios. The format also encourages more spontaneous questions, stress-testing the candidate’s ability to think on their feet and adapt to new challenges.

# 5. [Potential Pitfalls](/pitfalls)

While this method has its advantages, it does require that the candidate be thoroughly prepared to discuss their project in detail. Be mindful that some candidates may not have a project that aligns perfectly with your domain, which could create a disconnect. Additionally, while this approach may not work for every interview, it can be particularly effective for roles that require deeper technical discussions and real-world problem-solving.

# 6. [Closing the Deal](/closing)

A successful demo interview doesn’t just show your technical skills—it demonstrates your ability to communicate, adapt, and think critically in real-time. For interviewers, this process offers a unique perspective on how candidates approach problem-solving in practical, real-world scenarios. For interviewees, it’s an opportunity to leave a lasting impression by taking control of the narrative. Embrace the conversation, be open to feedback, and show them how you’ll make an impact beyond just answering questions.

[^1]: To clarify, A *career job interview*, in this context, is any interview for a higher-level (senior and above) position that would benefit from a demonstration of knowledge approach.
