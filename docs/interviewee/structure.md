# How to Prepare and Structure Your Demo

Preparing for a demo requires careful planning to ensure you can confidently guide the interview and answer questions along the way. Here’s how to structure it:

1. **Choose the Right Project**: Pick a project that aligns with the company’s interests or highlights the skills they are looking for. Ideally, it should solve a real-world problem that you can explain in detail.

2. **Know Your Project Inside and Out**: Be ready to explain any part of the project, from high-level architecture to specific code decisions. Understand why you made the choices you did and be prepared to discuss them.

3. **Rehearse Handling Questions**: Practice explaining your thought process clearly and concisely. Be ready to answer questions like:
   - _"Why did you choose this technology stack?"_
   - _"What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?"_
   - _"If you were to do it again, what would you change?"_

4. **Anticipate Deeper Questions**: Expect technical deep dives. If they ask about performance, edge cases, or scalability, show that you’ve thought about and addressed these aspects.

5. **Structure the Demo**:
   - **Set the Context**: Start by explaining the project’s purpose and the problem it solves.
   - **Walk Through Key Features**: Demonstrate the core features, explaining your design decisions and technical challenges.
   - **Encourage Questions**: Invite the interviewers to ask questions at any time to create an interactive experience.
