# What This Approach Achieves

By using a demo in your interview, you create a deeper, more practical evaluation of your skills. Hereâ€™s what this approach can achieve:

1. **Showcase Depth and Breadth**: A demo lets you dive deep into your problem-solving process, while also showing your ability to handle a range of challenges. It highlights your expertise more effectively than answering isolated questions.

2. **Real-World Problem Solving**: Instead of working through hypothetical scenarios, you demonstrate your skills on real-world problems, making it easier for interviewers to see how your abilities translate to their needs.

3. **Adapt to Spontaneous Questions**: The interactive nature of the demo allows for real-time questions, giving you the chance to showcase your ability to think on your feet and adapt to new challenges during the interview.
