# Flip the Interview on Its Head, Do a Demo Instead!

This guide presents a novel approach to career job interviews in the tech industry, particularly helpful for candidates who want to showcase their strengths in a more dynamic way. Traditional technical interviews often focus on coding challenges and rapid problem-solving, which don’t always mirror the realities of software development.

That’s why you can take control of the process by flipping the interview on its head: offer to do a demo instead.

This guide will help you prepare to present this idea to interviewers and walk you through how to structure and deliver a live demonstration of your work, helping you stand out and create a more interactive, engaging interview experience.

# 1. [Presenting the Idea](/intro)

In most interviews, you're expected to answer technical questions or solve problems on the spot. However, this doesn’t always allow you to showcase your real-world experience. When you propose a demo, you’re suggesting a shift in focus: instead of just answering questions, you invite the interviewers to explore something you’ve built. Let them know they can ask questions at any point, making it a two-way conversation that demonstrates your expertise.

# 2. [Why Do a Demo?](/why)

A demo allows you to show what you’ve accomplished instead of just explaining concepts. You’re in control of the narrative, choosing a project that highlights your strengths and aligns with the company’s interests. This format also encourages a more relaxed dialogue, where you can engage with real-time questions, giving the interviewers a clearer understanding of your thought process and decision-making.

# 3. [How to Prepare and Structure Your Demo](/structure)

When setting up the interview, encourage candidates to choose a project that aligns with your company’s interests or demonstrates the skills relevant to the role. Make it clear that you expect a thorough walkthrough of their technical decisions, design choices, and implementation details. Let them know it’s an open forum, where you’ll ask questions throughout, ensuring the conversation remains interactive rather than a one-sided presentation.

# 4. [What This Approach Achieves](/what)

This method allows you to focus on both depth and breadth, gaining a more thorough understanding of the candidate’s expertise. By seeing how they handle a real project, you’ll be able to assess their problem-solving skills within a practical context, moving away from abstract or hypothetical scenarios. The format also encourages more spontaneous questions, stress-testing the candidate’s ability to think on their feet and adapt to new challenges.

# 5. [How to Avoid Pitfalls](/pitfalls)

While this method has its advantages, it does require that the candidate be thoroughly prepared to discuss their project in detail. Be mindful that some candidates may not have a project that aligns perfectly with your domain, which could create a disconnect. Additionally, while this approach may not work for every interview, it can be particularly effective for roles that require deeper technical discussions and real-world problem-solving.

# 6. [How to Close the Interview Strong](/closing)

A successful demo interview doesn’t just show your technical skills—it demonstrates your ability to communicate, adapt, and think critically in real-time. For interviewers, this process offers a unique perspective on how candidates approach problem-solving in practical, real-world scenarios. For interviewees, it’s an opportunity to leave a lasting impression by taking control of the narrative. Embrace the conversation, be open to feedback, and show them how you’ll make an impact beyond just answering questions.
