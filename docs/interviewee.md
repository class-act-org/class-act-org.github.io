# Flip the Interview on Its Head, Do a Demo Instead!

This guide presents a novel approach to career job interviews in the tech industry, particularly helpful for candidates who want to showcase their strengths in a more dynamic way. Traditional technical interviews often focus on coding challenges and rapid problem-solving, which don’t always mirror the realities of software development.

That’s why you can take control of the process by flipping the interview on its head: offer to do a demo instead.

This guide will help you prepare to present this idea to interviewers and walk you through how to structure and deliver a live demonstration of your work, helping you stand out and create a more interactive, engaging interview experience.

# 1. [Presenting the Idea](/intro)

In most interviews, you're expected to answer technical questions or solve problems on the spot. However, this doesn’t always allow you to showcase your real-world experience. When you propose a demo, you’re suggesting a shift in focus: instead of just answering questions, you invite the interviewers to explore something you’ve built. Let them know they can ask questions at any point, making it a two-way conversation that demonstrates your expertise.

# 2. [Why Do a Demo?](/why)

A demo allows you to show what you’ve accomplished instead of just explaining concepts. You’re in control of the narrative, choosing a project that highlights your strengths and aligns with the company’s interests. This format also encourages a more relaxed dialogue, where you can engage with real-time questions, giving the interviewers a clearer understanding of your thought process and decision-making.

# 3. [How to Prepare and Structure Your Demo](/structure)

Choose a project that demonstrates your skills and is relevant to the role you’re applying for. Prepare to walk through your decisions step by step—be ready to explain design choices, technical trade-offs, and specific lines of code if necessary. Encourage questions from the interviewers, making the experience interactive. This isn’t just a presentation; it’s a conversation where you can dive deep and address their curiosity.

# 4. [What This Approach Achieves](/what)

By leading with a demo, you highlight both the depth and breadth of your skills. You’re showing your ability to solve real-world problems, which interviewers can connect to the challenges they face. This method also allows for spontaneous questions, testing your ability to think on your feet and adapt to new inquiries, which can leave a lasting impression.

# 5. [How to Avoid Pitfalls](/pitfalls)

The key to success is thorough preparation. Make sure you know your project inside out and can answer questions at any level of depth. If your project isn’t directly related to the company’s domain, find ways to connect it to the job you're interviewing for. While this approach may not work for every interview, in the right context, it can set you apart from other candidates.

# 6. [How to Close the Interview Strong](/closing)

A successful demo not only showcases your technical abilities but also highlights your communication skills, adaptability, and ability to engage with complex problems. By using this approach, you leave interviewers with a clear sense of how you operate in real-world scenarios. Encourage open feedback and be ready to explain how your skills will translate into real impact for their team.
