# Flip the Interview on Its Head: Do a Demo Instead!

Welcome to a guide that introduces a novel approach to [technical interviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_interview) in the software industry: flipping the interview by focusing on a live demo of your work. This technique is beneficial for both interviewers and interviewees, creating a more engaging, practical way to assess and showcase technical skills.

Whether you're the interviewer looking for a deeper understanding of a candidate's capabilities or the interviewee wanting to take control of the interview process, this guide will walk you through how to successfully implement this approach.

## For Interviewers

As an interviewer, this method helps you gain a clearer, more hands-on understanding of a candidate's problem-solving abilities. Rather than sticking to coding challenges and questions, you’ll be able to see how the candidate works in real-world scenarios, engage with their project, and ask detailed questions.

**Explore how to:**

- Encourage candidates to demo their work.
- Ask the right questions during a demo.
- Evaluate a candidate's ability to adapt and explain their decisions.
