# Introduction: Flipping the Interview as an Stakeholder

In traditional technical interviews, the emphasis is often placed on a candidate’s ability to solve coding challenges or answer hypothetical questions quickly. While this approach can test certain skills, it doesn’t always reveal how candidates will perform in real-world, day-to-day situations—particularly when it comes to solving actual business problems.

By **flipping the interview**, you invite the candidate to demonstrate their work in a hands-on way by walking you through a project they’ve built. This allows you to assess not only their technical proficiency but also their problem-solving process, decision-making skills, and ability to communicate complex ideas.

### Why Flip the Interview?

Shifting the focus from isolated questions to a live demo provides several advantages:

1. **Real-World Insights**: Instead of theoretical problem-solving, you see firsthand how a candidate tackles real-world challenges. This offers a clearer picture of how their skills will apply to the types of projects they’d work on with your team.
   
2. **Evaluate Thought Process**: A demo allows you to dig into the candidate’s decision-making process, asking questions about why certain technical decisions were made, how challenges were addressed, and what trade-offs were considered.
   
3. **Interactive Dialogue**: Unlike a traditional interview, where candidates respond to predefined questions, a demo encourages a more organic, two-way conversation. You can dive deeper into areas of interest, making the interview more engaging and insightful.

### How Does It Work?

As an stakeholder, you would ask the candidate to walk through a project they’ve built, ideally one that showcases relevant skills for the role. During the demo, you can:

- Ask about the project's goals and the problems it solves.
- Dive into specific technical details, exploring their approach to design, architecture, or particular challenges.
- Assess how well the candidate can communicate their ideas, explaining complex decisions in a way that makes sense to both technical and non-technical team members.

By encouraging the candidate to walk through their work, you shift the focus from answering theoretical questions to showcasing how they apply their skills in real-world scenarios. This shift in approach often leads to a more engaging and revealing interview.

### Setting the Stage

To introduce this concept to the candidate, you can frame it as an opportunity for them to showcase their work in a practical setting. Here’s how you might present the idea during the interview:

> _"Rather than focusing on typical coding challenges, I’d like to invite you to walk me through a project you’ve worked on. This will give us a chance to see how you solve real-world problems and the technical decisions you made along the way."_

This method helps create a more collaborative and dynamic interview environment, giving both you and the candidate a clearer picture of their fit for the role.
