# Presenting the Idea: Flipping the Interview

In most interviews, you’re expected to answer technical questions or solve coding challenges on the spot. While this can assess certain skills, it doesn’t always give you the opportunity to showcase your full potential or how you solve real-world problems. By flipping the interview and proposing a demo instead, you can guide the conversation and show what you’re truly capable of.

Here’s how you can propose the idea in a natural and confident way:

- Bring it up after introductions: Once the initial pleasantries are out of the way, smoothly transition into the demo suggestion:

    > _"Before we dive into the usual technical questions, I’d love to try something a little different. Would you be open to me walking you through a project I’ve built, so we can discuss how I tackled real-world challenges?"_

- Make it collaborative: Frame the demo as an opportunity for them to engage with your work directly:

    > _"During the demo, feel free to stop me at any point and ask questions about the design decisions or technical challenges. This way, we can really dig into the details that are most relevant to the role."_

- Highlight the benefits: Emphasize how this approach reflects the day-to-day nature of software development:

    > _"I believe this will give us a chance to focus on the real-world problems I’ve solved and how that applies to what you’re looking for in this role."_
