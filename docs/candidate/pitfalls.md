# How to Avoid Pitfalls

While a demo can be a powerful tool, there are a few potential pitfalls to be mindful of. Here’s how to avoid them:

1. **Thorough Preparation is Key**: You need to know your project inside and out. Be prepared to answer any level of detail, from high-level architecture to specific code choices. Lack of preparation can lead to uncertainty during the interview.

2. **Relevance to the Company**: Ensure that your project aligns with the company’s domain or needs. If the project seems too disconnected from their focus, it may be harder for stakeholders to see its value. Try to draw parallels between your demo and their work.

3. **Keep It Flexible**: This format won’t work for every interview or every role. Be adaptable and gauge whether the stakeholders are open to this approach. If not, be ready to switch back to a more traditional interview format.
