# Potential Pitfalls

While the demo-based interview offers significant advantages, it’s important to be aware of potential pitfalls that can undermine its effectiveness. Here are some common challenges and strategies to avoid them:

### 1. Misalignment with the Role

One of the key challenges with a demo-based interview is ensuring that the project the candidate presents is relevant to the role you’re hiring for. If the project doesn’t align with your company’s domain or the specific skills required, it can be difficult to assess the candidate’s fit.

- **How to Avoid**: During the interview setup, provide the candidate with guidance on selecting a relevant project. You might suggest they focus on a project that aligns with the technologies or challenges your team faces. If the candidate’s demo still doesn’t seem aligned, ask them how they would apply the same problem-solving approach or technical decisions to your company’s specific needs.

### 2. Surface-Level Presentation

Some candidates may prepare a polished demo but fail to dive deeply into the technical details. This can lead to a surface-level understanding of their skills and problem-solving abilities.

- **How to Avoid**: Encourage the candidate to dive deep into their technical decisions and challenges during the demo. Ask probing questions like:

  > _"Can you explain the trade-offs you considered when choosing this architecture?"_

  > _"What specific challenges did you face with performance, and how did you resolve them?"_
  
This will ensure you get a more complete picture of their technical depth.

### 3. Overemphasis on Presentation Skills

While a demo can provide insight into a candidate’s communication and technical skills, there’s a risk that stakeholders may overemphasize presentation skills, which may not be directly relevant to the role.

- **How to Avoid**: Keep the focus on the **content** of the demo rather than how polished the presentation is. Make sure to assess the candidate’s technical decisions, problem-solving approach, and adaptability rather than how smooth or well-rehearsed the demo is. You can even ask questions that shift the candidate’s focus away from the script, such as:

>  _"What were the most challenging parts of this project, and how did you handle them?"_

### 4. Failing to Assess Adaptability

While a demo offers great insight into a candidate’s prepared project, it doesn’t always test how well they can adapt to new challenges or feedback on the spot.

- **How to Avoid**: During the demo, ask the candidate about alternative approaches or how they would handle new requirements. For example:

> _"If this project had required you to scale to ten times the traffic, what changes would you have made?"_

> _"How would you modify your approach if you had to switch to a different technology stack?"_

These questions will help you assess their ability to think on their feet and adapt to changing circumstances.

### 5. Overcomplicating the Demo

Sometimes, candidates may choose projects that are overly complex or difficult to explain in a limited time frame. This can make it hard for you to fully grasp their contributions or technical decisions.

- **How to Avoid**: Encourage the candidate to focus on a project they can explain thoroughly within the time allotted. If the project is large, suggest they focus on a few key components rather than trying to cover everything. You can also guide the discussion by focusing on specific aspects of the project that are most relevant to the role:

>  _"Let’s focus on how you handled the performance bottlenecks in this system."_

### 6. Lack of Preparation by the Candidate

A demo-based interview requires thorough preparation from the candidate. If the candidate is underprepared, it can lead to an ineffective or disorganized demo.

- **How to Avoid**: Set clear expectations for the candidate in advance. Let them know that you’ll be asking in-depth technical questions and expect a detailed walk-through of their project. If they seem unprepared during the interview, you can pivot by asking broader questions to gauge their overall thought process and problem-solving approach.

### Conclusion

While the demo format offers numerous benefits, being aware of these potential pitfalls ensures that you get the most value from the interview. By providing clear guidance to the candidate, asking the right questions, and maintaining a focus on technical depth and relevance, you can avoid these challenges and ensure a successful, insightful interview.
