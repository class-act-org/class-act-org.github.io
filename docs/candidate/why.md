# Why Do a Demo?

Choosing to do a demo shifts the focus of the interview from theoretical problem-solving to practical, real-world application of your skills. Here’s why this approach can benefit you:

- **Control the Narrative:** When you demo something you’ve built, you guide the conversation. You’re presenting a project you’re confident in, which helps you explain your skills in a context you’re comfortable with.

- **Show, Don’t Tell:** Instead of explaining what you can do, you show it in action. The demo provides tangible proof of your abilities and how you solve real problems, making it easier for stakeholders to see your competence.

- **Create Engagement:** A demo encourages a back-and-forth dialogue. Stakeholders can ask questions in real time, giving you the opportunity to explain your thought process and adapt your answers to their interests.
