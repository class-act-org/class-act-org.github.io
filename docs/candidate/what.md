# What Does This Achieve?

Flipping the interview to focus on a live demo allows you to gain a more comprehensive and practical understanding of a candidate’s abilities. By shifting away from traditional coding exercises and focusing on real-world applications, this approach achieves several key benefits for stakeholders.

### 1. Depth Over Breadth

Traditional interviews often jump between various topics, testing a candidate’s surface-level knowledge across multiple areas. A demo, on the other hand, allows you to dig deeper into the candidate’s work:

- **Understand Technical Depth**: By focusing on a single project, you can explore how thoroughly the candidate understands the technologies and solutions they’ve implemented. You can ask specific questions that dive deep into their thought process, technical decisions, and problem-solving strategies.
  
- **Explore Challenges in Detail**: Candidates can walk you through complex challenges they faced, such as scaling, security, or performance optimization, and explain how they solved them. This depth gives you a clearer sense of their ability to handle real-world problems.

### 2. Real-World Problem Solving

One of the major limitations of traditional technical interviews is that they often assess a candidate’s ability to solve hypothetical problems or whiteboard exercises. These exercises, while useful in certain ways, don’t always reflect how a candidate approaches challenges in a real working environment.

- **Showcase Practical Skills**: A demo focuses on how a candidate has applied their skills in real-world projects, providing insights into how they would tackle similar challenges on your team.
  
- **Highlight Relevant Experience**: You can see how the candidate’s past experiences align with the challenges and goals of your company, allowing for a more relevant and job-specific evaluation of their abilities.

### 3. Interactive Dialogue and Adaptability

Unlike traditional interviews where candidates are mostly reacting to pre-planned questions, a demo fosters a two-way conversation that is more dynamic and responsive:

- **Engage in Real-Time**: The demo format encourages a more natural, interactive dialogue. As the candidate walks you through their project, you can ask real-time questions about decisions, trade-offs, and challenges, allowing for a more genuine assessment of their thought process.

- **Test Problem-Solving Adaptability**: By asking follow-up questions or requesting deeper insights into certain areas of the project, you can test how well the candidate adapts to unexpected questions or new information. This is crucial in understanding how they would handle real-world issues under pressure.

### 4. Clearer Insight into Communication Skills

Communication is a key skill in software development, especially when working within teams or explaining complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. A demo allows you to assess how well a candidate can explain their work:

- **Evaluate Technical Communication**: Does the candidate clearly articulate the problems they faced and the decisions they made? Can they explain their thought process in a way that’s understandable and logical, both to technical and non-technical audiences?
  
- **Assess Collaboration Potential**: The demo provides a sense of how the candidate will communicate and collaborate with your team, particularly when discussing technical challenges or making decisions about architecture and design.

### 5. Tailored to the Role

By focusing the demo on a project that aligns with the skills required for the job, you can ensure that the interview is relevant to the position you’re hiring for. This tailored approach allows you to make a more informed decision based on how the candidate’s experience applies to your specific needs:

- **Relevant Skills in Action**: Instead of testing general problem-solving abilities, you can see the exact skills that are critical for your role, such as how the candidate designs scalable systems, handles security, or implements user interfaces.
  
- **Directly Applicable Experience**: The candidate’s demo gives you a clearer picture of how their past work applies to the problems your team is solving. This makes it easier to assess their fit for the role and whether they have the experience to handle the job’s responsibilities.

### 6. Better Hiring Decisions

Overall, this approach gives you a more holistic understanding of the candidate’s abilities and potential fit within your team:

- **In-Depth Knowledge**: You walk away with a deeper understanding of the candidate’s technical skills, how they apply those skills in real-world scenarios, and how they handle complex challenges.
  
- **Stronger Cultural Fit Assessment**: Through the demo, you also gain insights into the candidate’s communication style, adaptability, and how they engage with feedback—key factors for assessing whether they’ll thrive in your team’s environment.

- **Informed Decisions**: By using a demo, you gather more meaningful data about the candidate’s strengths and weaknesses, leading to better, more confident hiring decisions.

By using a demo-based approach, you gain deeper insights into a candidate’s real-world abilities, communication skills, and adaptability, ultimately helping you make more informed hiring decisions. This structured evaluation offers a richer understanding than traditional interview formats typically provide.
